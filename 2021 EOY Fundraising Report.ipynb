Almost half of all donors were recurring donors ({{pct_donors}}%) and recurring donations made up over half of the money raised ({{pct_amount}}%).\n ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"recur_2021","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"recur_2020","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"recurring","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import altair\nchart_monthly_new_reccuring = altair.Chart.from_json(\"\"\"\n{\n    \"width\": 500,\n    \"height\": 500,\n    \"$schema\": \"https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v4.json\",\n    \"layer\": [\n        {\n            \"data\": {\n                \"name\": \"layer00\"\n            },\n            \"mark\": {\n                \"tooltip\": true,\n                \"type\": \"bar\",\n                \"clip\": true\n            },\n            \"encoding\": {\n                \"x\": {\n                    \"field\": \"month\",\n                    \"type\": \"temporal\",\n                    \"title\": \"Month\"\n                },\n                \"y\": {\n                    \"field\": \"count\",\n                    \"type\": \"quantitative\",\n                    \"title\": \"# of New Recurring Donors\"\n                },\n                \"color\": {\n                    \"value\": \"#654A94\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"resolve\": {\n        \"scale\": {}\n    },\n    \"datasets\": {\n        \"layer00\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"dummy\",\n                \"value\": 0\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\"\"\")\nchart_monthly_new_reccuring.datasets.layer00 = monthly_new_reccuring.to_json(orient='records')\nchart_monthly_new_reccuring.display(actions=False)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import jinja2\n# raw_query = \"\"\"\n#     with donations as (\n#     \n#       select * from sunrise_dbt.donations\n#       where paid_at like '%2021%'\n#     \n#     ),\n#     \n#     donation_amount as (\n#     \n#     select\n#       case\n#        when amount between 0.01 and 49.99 then 'Under 50'\n#        when amount between 50.00 and 99.99 then '50-99'\n#        when amount between 100.00 and 499.99 then '100-499'\n#        when amount between 500.00 and 999.99 then '500-999'\n#        when amount between 1000.00 and 4999.99 then '1,000-4,999'\n#        when amount between 5000.00 and 9999.99 then '5,000-9,999'\n#        when amount between 10000.00 and 19999.99 then '10,000-19,999'\n#        when amount between 20000.00 and 99999.99 then '20,000-99,999'\n#        when amount between 100000.00 and 249999.99 then '100,000-249,999'\n#        when amount between 250000.00 and 499999.99 then '250,000-499,999'\n#        when amount between 500000.00 and 999999.99 then '500,000-999,999'\n#        when amount between 1000000.00 and 4999999.99 then '1,000,000-4,999,999'\n#        when amount <= 5000000.00 then '5,000,000+'\n#        else null end as amount_bucket,\n#       sum(amount) as amount\n#     from donations\n#     group by 1\n#     ),\n#     \n#     donation_order as (\n#       select * from donation_amount\n#       order by\n#         case when amount_bucket ='Under 50' then 1\n#              when amount_bucket ='50-99' then 2\n#              when amount_bucket ='100-499' then 3\n#              when amount_bucket ='500-999' then 4\n#              when amount_bucket ='1,000-4,999' then 5\n#              when amount_bucket ='5,000-9,999' then 6\n#              when amount_bucket ='10,000-19,999' then 7\n#              when amount_bucket ='20,000-99,999' then 8\n#              when amount_bucket ='100,000-249,999' then 9\n#              when amount_bucket ='250,000-499,999' then 10\n#              when amount_bucket ='500,000-999,999' then 11\n#              when amount_bucket ='1,000,000-4,999,999' then 12\n#              when amount_bucket ='5,000,000+' then 13\n#              else null end\n#       )\n#     \n#     select * from donation_order\n# \"\"\"\n# sql_query = jinja2.Template(raw_query).render(vars())","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"amount_small = round(donation_bucket[\"amount\"].iloc[0], 2)\npct_small = round((amount_small / total_2021) * 100, 2)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Small Dollar Donations \n\nSmall dollar donations (under \\$50) raised \\${{amount_small}} (Graph 5), which was {{pct_small}}% of total donations in 2021.
